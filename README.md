# ACTPol-Foreground

This code represents a simple tool to compute the foreground model presented in [Choi et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07289) using [
fgspectra](https://github.com/simonsobs/fgspectra). It allows you to directly compare the results with a python transcription of what developed in the [software](https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/act/act_dr4_likelihood_multi_info.cfm) used by the ACT collaboration to compute the likelihood from multi-frequency spectra.

## Dependencies
- Python > 3
- numpy
- scipy
- yaml
- fgspectra
